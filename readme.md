## Lyft Rate Predicter

Enter the starting point and destination of a trip in the future, and get an
estimate for how long and how much.

## How It Works

The program constantly requests real-time estimates for rides generated by a
stochastic process, and stores the estimates. The estimate for a given trip is
computed by searching historical data for similar trips.

For instance, you want to know how long it will take and how much money it will
cost to get from The Marriot to the airport two months from now, when you are
flying home from vacation. You enter the trip and the time into a web/mobile
interface, and get back a duration in minutes and a price in dollars (or local
currency).

## Installing

This project is developed with:

* [Python3.6.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/)
* [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

Once those tools are installed on your system, get the code and set up the
virtual environment like so:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mroll/rate-predictr.git
$ cd rate-predictr
$ mkvirtualenv rate-predictr
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Commands currently supported by the cli:

### add_location

```
$ ./main.py add_location boston_common --lat=42.354706 --lng=-71.066450
```

This will add a row to the `location` database table. The row will have the name
`boston_common` and the lat and longtide values seen above. This is a
convencience method for adding locations to be used by the `get_costs` command.

### get_costs

```
$ ./main.py get_costs --center=boston_common --radius=R N
```

This will query the Lyft API for cost estimates for `N` trips randomly selected
in an `R` mile radius around center. The trips and the returned estimate will be
recorded in the database.

See `util.py:random_point_in_circle` for how the coordinates of the start and
end location of the trip are generated.
