## Lyft Rate Predicter

Enter the starting point and destination of a trip in the future, and get an
estimate for how long and how much.

## How It Works

The program constantly requests real-time estimates for rides generated by a
stochastic process, and stores the estimates. The estimate for a given trip is
computed by searching historical data for similar trips.

For instance, you want to know how long it will take and how much money it will
cost to get from The Marriot to the airport two months from now, when you are
flying home from vacation. You enter the trip and the time into a web/mobile
interface, and get back a duration in minutes and a price in dollars (or local
currency).
